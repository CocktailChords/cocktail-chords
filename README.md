# Cocktail Chords

# Project Description:
This project is a react application that allows a user to select a cocktail category which returns a list of cocktails. When the user selects a cocktail in that category, it returns the information of the cocktail 
plus a song that matches the cocktail. The reason we opted for this was becuase we wanted our users to have something to listen to while they have their cocktail.
